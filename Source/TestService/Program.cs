			 Debug:
			 In debug mode, the application runs as a Windows application and the service debugger is shown so 
			 that you can start and stop the service for debugging. 

			 Release:
			 In release mode, the Service Debugger is compiled out so that the Windows service behaves normally 
			 and need not be deployed with the service. 

			 Development:
			 You DO NOT NEED TO include the code for the service debugger in the Windows service solution. 
			 Just compile the service debugger in release mode, then add the resulting ServiceDebugger.dll to 
			 your Windows Service as a design-time library.
